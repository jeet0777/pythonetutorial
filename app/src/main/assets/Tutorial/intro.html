<p class = p1>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting 
language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords.</p>

constructions than other languages.</p>

<p>You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar 
to PERL and PHP.</p>



<p><b>Python is Interactive: </b>You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact 
with the interpreter directly to write your programs.
<p><b>Python is Object-Oriented:</b> Python supports Object-Oriented style or 
technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
<p><b>Python is a Beginner's Language:</b> Python is a great language for the 
beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of 
applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</p>
