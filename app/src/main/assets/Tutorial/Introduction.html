<h1>introduction</h1>
Python is a general-purpose interpreted powerful high-level, object-oriented programming language.<br/>
It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990 at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.<br/>
It has simple easy-to-use syntax, making it the perfect language for someone trying to learn computer programming for the first time.<br/>
Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).<br/>
Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.<br/>

<b>* Web Applications:</b><br/>
You can create scalable Web Apps using frameworks and CMS (Content Management System) that are built on Python. Instagram, YouTube, Spotify all has been developed in Python.<br/>
<br/>
<b>* Scientific and Computational Applications:</b><br/>
The higher speeds, productivity and availability of tools, such as Scientific Python and Numeric Python, have resulted in Python becoming an integral part of applications involved in computation and processing of scientific data. <br/>
3D modeling software, such as FreeCAD, and finite element method software, such as Abaqus, are coded in Python.<br/>
<br/>
<b>* Games:</b><br/>
Python has various modules, libraries and platforms that support development of games. For example, PySoy is a 3D game engine supporting Python 3, and PyGame provides functionality and a library for game development.<br/>
<br/>
<b>* Enterprise and Business Applications:</b><br/>
With features that include special libraries, extensibility, scalability and easily readable syntax, Python is a suitable coding language for customizing larger applications.<br/>
<br/>
<b>* Prototyping:</b><br/>
Besides being quick and easy to learn, Python also has the open source advantage of being free with the support of a large community. This makes it the preferred choice for prototype development.</pre></html>
