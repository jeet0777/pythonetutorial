    <h1>Module</h1>
You have seen how you can reuse code in your program by defining functions once. What if you wanted to reuse a number of functions in other programs that you write? As you might have guessed, the answer is modules.<br/>
<br/>
A module allows you to logically organize your Python code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference.<br/>
<br/>
Simply, a module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code.<br/>
<br/>
There are various methods of writing modules, but the simplest way is to create a file with a .py extension that contains functions and variables.<br/>

<b>- Code Reuse:</b> Modules let programmers save source code in files permanently & hence the codes in module files are persistent. Module codes can rerun as many times as required.<br/>
<br/>
<b>- System Namespace Partitioning:</b> In Python, the highest-level organizational unit of code is the Modules. Although they are just packages with names - these packages are self-contained. Like that of a local scope of functions, modules help to avoid name clashes across the program. So in a module, all the objects and codes are implicitly enclosed or bounded. Hence, modules are the natural programming tools used to group system components.<br/>
<br/>
<b>- Shared Service or data Implementation:</b> From the operational point of view, modules are also used to implement components that are shared across systems. For example, if a programmer needs to provide a global object which will be used by more than one files or function blocks, then the code can be used as a module that can be imported by several files.<br/>
<br/>
Let us create a module. Type the following and save it as example.py.<br/>
<br/>
# Python Module example<br/>
<i><br/>
def add(a, b):<br/>
   """This program adds two<br/>
   numbers and return the result"""<br/>
<br/>
   result = a + b<br/>
   return result</i><br/>
<br/>
Here, we have defined a function add() inside a module named example. The function takes in two numbers and returns their sum.</html>
