    <h2>Installing Python</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Python distribution is available for a wide variety of platforms. You need to download 
only the binary code applicable for your platform and install Python.</p>
<p>If the binary code for your platform is not available, you need a C compiler to compile 
the source code manually.</p> <p>Compiling the source code offers more flexibility in terms of choice of features that you require in your installation.<p>
Here is a quick overview of installing Python on various platforms:</p>

<h3>Windows Installation</h3>
<hr>
<p>Here are the steps to install Python on Windows machine.</p> 
<ul>
<li>Open a Web browser and go to  "http://www.python.org/download/"</li>
<li> Follow the link for the Windows installer python-XYZ.msi file where XYZ is the 
version you need to install.</li>
<li>To use this installer python-XYZ.msi, the Windows system must support </li>
<li>Microsoft Installer 2.0. Save the installer file to your local machine and then 
run it to find out if your machine supports MSI.</li>
<li>Run the downloaded file. This brings up the Python install wizard, which is 
really easy to use. Just accept the default settings, wait until the install is 
finished, and you are done.</li>
<br><h3>Setting path at Windows</h3>

<b>At the command prompt:</b> type path %path%;C:\Python and press Enter.<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> C:\Python is the path of the Python directory
