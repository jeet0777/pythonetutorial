    <title>Single statement Blocks</title>
    
    
    <h1>single statement</h1>
We have seen that each block of statements is set apart from the rest by its own indentation level. Well, there is one caveat. If your block of statements contains only one single statement, then you can specify it on the same line of, say, a conditional statement or looping statement. The following example should make this clear:<br/>
<br/>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; flag = True<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; if flag: print('Yes')<br/>
...<br/>
Yes</i><br/>
<br/>
Notice that the single statement is used in-place and not as a separate block. Although, you can use this for making your program smaller, I strongly recommend avoiding this short-cut method, except for error checking, mainly because it will be much easier to add an extra statement if you are using proper indentation.</html><script>
