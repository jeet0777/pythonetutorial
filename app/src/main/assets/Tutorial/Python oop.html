    <h1>OOP</h1>
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Meaning, it supports different programming approach.<br/>
<br/>
One of the popular approach to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).<br/>
<br/>
Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming. A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class. An analogy is that you can have variables of type int which translates to saying that variables that store integers are variables which are instances (objects) of the int class.<br/>
<br/>
An object has two characteristics:<br/>
- attributes<br/>
- behavior<br/>
<br/>
Let's take an example:<br/>
Parrot is an object,<br/>
- name, age, color are attributes<br/>
- singing, dancing are behavior<br/>
<br/>
Objects can store data using ordinary variables that belong to the object. <br/>
Variables that belong to an object or class are referred to as <b>fields</b>. <br/>
Objects can also have functionality by using functions that belong to a class. Such functions are called <b>methods</b> of the class. <br/>
This terminology is important because it helps us to differentiate between functions and variables<br/>
which are independent and those which belong to a class or object. Collectively, the fields<br/>
and methods can be referred to as the attributes of that class.<br/>
Fields are of two types - they can belong to each instance/object of the class or they can<br/>
belong to the class itself. They are called instance variables and class variables<br/>
respectively.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).<br/>
<br/>
In Python, the concept of OOP follows some basic principles:<br/>
<b>Inheritance</b><br/>
The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.<br/>
<b>Encapsulation</b><br/>
Hiding the private details of a class from other objects.<br/>
<b>Polymorphism</b><br/>
A concept of using common operation in different ways for different data input. (we will cover this with inheritance)</html><script>
