    <h1>Function</h1>
<br/>
The function concept is probably the most important building block of any non-trivial software (in any programming language), so we will explore various aspects of functions in this chapter.<br/>
<br/>
Functions are defined using the def keyword. After this keyword comes an identifier name for the function, followed by a pair of parentheses which may enclose some names of variables, and by the final colon that ends the line. Next follows the block of statements that are part of this function. An example will show that this is actually very simple:<br/>
<br/>
<b>Example</b> (save as function1.py ):<br/>
<i>def say_hello():<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;# block belonging to the function<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print('hello world')<br/>
# End of function<br/>
say_hello() # call the function<br/>
say_hello() # call the function again</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Output:</b><br/>
$ python function1.py<br/>
hello world<br/>
hello world<br/>
<br/>
<b>How It Works</b><br/>
We define a function called say_hello using the syntax as explained above. This function takes no parameters and hence there are no variables declared in the parentheses.<br/>
Parameters to functions are just input to the function so that we can pass in different values to it and get back corresponding results.<br/>
<br/>
Notice that we can call the same function twice which means we do not have to write the same code again.</html>
