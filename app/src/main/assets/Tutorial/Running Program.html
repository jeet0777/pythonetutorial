<html><h1>Running Program</h1>
We will now see how to run a traditional 'Hello World' program in Python. This will teach you how to write, save and run Python programs.<br/>
There are two ways of using Python to run your program - using the interactive interpreter prompt or using a source file. We will now see how to use both of these methods.<br/>
<br/>
<font color="#E91E63"><b>Using The Interpreter Prompt</b></font><br/>
Open the terminal in your operating system and then open the Python prompt by typing python3 and pressing <i>[enter]</i> key.<br/>
Once you have started Python, you should see >>> where you can start typing stuff. This is called the Python interpreter prompt.<br/>
<br/>
At the Python interpreter prompt, type:<br/>
<i>print("Hello World")</i><br/>
followed by the <i>[enter]</i> key. You should see the words Hello World printed to the screen.<br/>
<br/>
Python gives you the output of the line immediately! What you just entered is a single Python statement. We use <i>print</i> to (unsurprisingly) print any value that you supply to it. <br/>
Here, we are supplying the text Hello World and this is promptly printed to the screen.<br/>
<br/>
<font color="#E91E63"><b>How to Quit the Interpreter Prompt</b></font><br/>
If you are using a GNU/Linux or OS X shell, you can exit the interpreter prompt by pressing <i>[ctrl + d]</i> or entering <i>exit()</i> (note: remember to include the parentheses, () ) followed by the <i>[enter]</i> key.<br/>
If you are using the Windows command prompt, press <i>[ctrl + z]</i> followed by the <i>[enter]</i> key.<br/>
<br/>
<font color="#E91E63"><b>Choosing An Editor</b></font><br/>
We cannot type out our program at the interpreter prompt every time we want to run something, so we have to save them in files and can run our programs any number of times.<br/>
<br/>
To create our Python source files, we need an editor software where you can type and save.<br/>
A good programmer's editor will make your life easier in writing the source files. Hence, the choice of an editor is crucial indeed. <br/>
<br/>
One of the very basic requirements is syntax highlighting where all the different parts of your Python program are colorized so that you can see your program and visualize its running.<br/>
<br/>
If you have no idea where to start, I would recommend using <b>PyCharm</b> Educational Edition software which is available on Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux.<br/>
<br/>
If you are using Windows, do not use Notepad - it is a bad choice because it does not do syntax highlighting and also importantly it does not support indentation of the text which is very important in our case as we will see later. Good editors will automatically do this.<br/>
<br/>
If you are an experienced programmer, then you must be already using Vim or Emacs. Needless to say, these are two of the most powerful editors and you will benefit from using them to write your Python programs. I personally use both for most of my programs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<font color="#E91E63"><b>Using A Source File</b></font><br/>
Start your choice of editor, enter the following program and save it as hello.py<br/>
If you are using PyCharm, we have already discussed how to run from a source file.<br/>
For other editors, open a new file hello.py and type this:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>print("hello world")</i><br/>
<br/>
Where should you save the file? To any folder for which you know the location of the folder.<br/>
If you don't understand what that means, create a new folder and use that location to save and run all your Python programs:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>/tmp/py</i> on Mac OS X<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>/tmp/py</i> on GNU/Linux<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>C:\py</i> on Windows<br/>
<br/>
To create the above folder (for the operating system you are using), use the mkdir command in the terminal, for example, mkdir /tmp/py .<br/>
IMPORTANT: Always ensure that you give it the file extension of .py , for example, foo.py .<br/>
<br/>
To run your Python program:<br/>
1. Open a terminal window <br/>
2. Change directory to where you saved the file, for example, cd /tmp/py<br/>
3. Run the program by entering the command python hello.py . <br/>
The output is as shown below.<br/>
<i>$ python hello.py<br/>
hello world</i><br/>
<br/>
If you got the output as shown above, congratulations! - you have successfully run your first Python program. You have successfully crossed the hardest part of learning programming, which is, getting started with your first program!</html><script>
