<font color="#E91E63"><b>Python Statement</b></font><br/>
Instructions that a Python interpreter can execute are called statements. For example, a = 1 is an assignment statement. if statement, for statement, while statement etc. are other kinds of statements which will be discussed later.<br/>
<br/>
<font color="#E91E63"><b>Python Indentation</b></font><br/>
Most of the programming languages like C, C++, Java use braces { } to define a block of code. Python uses indentation.<br/>
<br/>
A code block (body of a function, loop etc.) starts with indentation and ends with the first unindented line. The amount of indentation is up to you, but it must be consistent throughout that block.<br/>
<br/>
Generally four whitespaces are used for indentation and is preferred over tabs. Here is an example.<br/>
<i>for i in range(1,11):<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print(i)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if i == 5:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break</i><br/>
<br/>
The enforcement of indentation in Python makes the code look neat and clean. This results into Python programs that look similar and consistent.<br/>
<br/>
<font color="#E91E63"><b>Python Comments</b></font><br/>
Comments are any text to the right of the # symbol and is mainly useful as notes for the reader of the program.<br/>
<b>Example:</b><br/>
<i>print('hello world') # Note that print is a function</i><br/>
<b>or:</b><br/>
<i># Note that print is a function<br/>
print('hello world')</i><br/>
<br/>
If we have comments that extend multiple lines use triple quotes, either ''' or """.<br/>
<br/>
These triple quotes are generally used for multi-line strings. But they can be used as multi-line comment as well. Unless they are not docstrings, they do not generate any extra code.<br/>
<br/>
<i>"""This is also a<br/>
perfect example of<br/>
multi-line comments"""</i><br/>
<br/>
Use as many useful comments as you can in your program to:<br/>
- explain assumptions<br/>
- explain important decisions<br/>
- explain important details<br/>
- explain problems you're trying to solve<br/>
- explain problems you're trying to overcome in your program, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Code tells you how, comments should tell you why.</i><br/>
This is useful for readers of your program so that they can easily understand what the program is doing. Remember, that person can be yourself after six months!</html><script>
