    In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is 
executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you 
need to execute a block of code several number of times. 
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more 
complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple 
times. The following diagram illustrates a loop statement:
Python programming language provides following types of loops to handle looping 
requirements.
<table border="1">
<th>loop type</th>
<th>Description</th>
<tr>
<td>while loop</td> 
<td>Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given 
condition is TRUE. It tests the condition before executing the 
loop body</td>
<tr>
<td>for loop</td>
<td>Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and 
abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.</td>

<h3>While Loop</h3>
A while loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a 
target statement as long as a given condition is true.
Syntax
The syntax of a while loop in Python programming language is:
while expression:
<hr>
 statement(s)
 <hr>
Here, statement(s) may be a single statement or a block of statements. 
The condition may be any expression, and true is any non-zero value. The loop 
iterates while the condition is true.
When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately 
following the loop.
In Python, all the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after 
a programming construct are considered to be part of a single block of code. Python 
uses indentation as its method of grouping statements.
<h3>Example</h3> 
<hr>
#!/usr/bin/python<br>
count = 0<br>
while (count < 9):<br> 
 print 'The count is:', count<br>
 count = count + 1<br>
print "Good bye!"<br> 
<hr>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:
<hr> 
The count is: 0
The count is: 1
The count is: 2
The count is: 3
The count is: 4
The count is: 5
The count is: 6
The count is: 7
The count is: 8
Good bye!

<h3>For Loop</h3>
<hr>
It has the ability to iterate over the items of any sequence, such as a list or a string.
<br><b>Syntax</b>
<hr>
for iterating_var in sequence:<br>
 statements(s)
 <hr>
 <p>If a sequence contains an expression list, it is evaluated first. Then, the first item in 
the sequence is assigned to the iterating variable iterating_var. Next, the statements 
block is executed. Each item in the list is assigned to iterating_var, and the 
statement(s) block is executed until the entire sequence is exhausted.</p>
<b>Example</b>
<hr>
#!/usr/bin/python<br>
for letter in 'Python': # First Example<br>
 print 'Current Letter :', letter<br>
fruits = ['banana', 'apple', 'mango']<br>
for fruit in fruits: # Second Example<br>
 print 'Current fruit :', fruit<br>

print "Good bye!"
<br><hr>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following <b>result:</b>
<hr>
Current Letter : P
Current Letter : y
Current Letter : t
Current Letter : h
Current Letter : o
Current Letter : n
Current fruit : banana
Current fruit : apple
Current fruit : mango
Good bye!>
