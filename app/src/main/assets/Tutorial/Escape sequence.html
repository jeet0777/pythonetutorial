<h1>escape sequence</h1>

For example, the string is <i>"What's your name?"</i>. <br/>
You cannot specify <i>'What's your name?'</i> because Python will be confused as to where the string starts and ends. So, you will have to specify that this single quote does not indicate the end of the string. <br/>
<br/>
This can be done with the help of what is called an <b>escape sequence</b>. You specify the single quote as \' : notice the backslash. Now, you can specify the string as <i>'What\'s your name?'</i> <br/>
<br/>
Another way of specifying this specific string would be "What's your name?" i.e. using double quotes. Similarly, you have to use an escape sequence for using a double quote itself in a double quoted string. Also, you have to indicate the backslash itself using the escape sequence \\ <br/>
<br/>
You can use an escape sequence for the newline character - \n to indicate the start of a new line. <br/>
An example is:<br/>
<i>'This is the first line\nThis is the second line'</i><br/>
<br/>
Another useful escape sequence to know is the tab: \t . There are many more escape sequences but I have mentioned only the most useful ones here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One thing to note is that in a string, a single backslash at the end of the line indicates that the string is continued in the next line, but no newline is added. <br/>
For example:<br/>
<i>"This is the first sentence. \<br/>
This is the second sentence."</i><br/>
<br/>
is equivalent to<br/>
<i>"This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence."</i></html>
